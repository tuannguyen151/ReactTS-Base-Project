# {{Project Name}} Fullstack Architecture Document

[[LLM: The default path and filename unless specified is docs/architecture.md]]

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. At minimum, you should have access to docs/prd.md and docs/front-end-spec.md. Ask the user for any documents you need but cannot locate. This template creates a unified architecture that covers both backend and frontend concerns to guide AI-driven fullstack development.]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding with architecture design, check if the project is based on any starter templates or existing codebases:

1. Review the PRD and other documents for mentions of:

- Fullstack starter templates (e.g., T3 Stack, MEAN/MERN starters, Django + React templates)
- Monorepo templates (e.g., Nx, Turborepo starters)
- Platform-specific starters (e.g., Vercel templates, AWS Amplify starters)
- Existing projects being extended or cloned

2. If starter templates or existing projects are mentioned:

- Ask the user to provide access (links, repos, or files)
- Analyze to understand pre-configured choices and constraints
- Note any architectural decisions already made
- Identify what can be modified vs what must be retained

3. If no starter is mentioned but this is greenfield:

- Suggest appropriate fullstack starters based on tech preferences
- Consider platform-specific options (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Let user decide whether to use one

4. Document the decision and any constraints it imposes

If none, state "N/A - Greenfield project"

## High Level Architecture

[[LLM: This section contains multiple subsections that establish the foundation. Present all subsections together, then apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol to the complete section.]]

### Technical Summary

[[LLM: Provide a comprehensive overview (4-6 sentences) covering:

- Overall architectural style and deployment approach
- Frontend framework and backend technology choices
- Key integration points between frontend and backend
- Infrastructure platform and services
- How this architecture achieves PRD goals]]

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

[[LLM: Based on PRD requirements and technical assumptions, make a platform recommendation:

1. Consider common patterns (not an exhaustive list, use your own best judgement and search the web as needed for emerging trends):

   - **Vercel + Supabase**: For rapid development with Next.js, built-in auth/storage
   - **AWS Full Stack**: For enterprise scale with Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Cognito
   - **Azure**: For .NET ecosystems or enterprise Microsoft environments
   - **Google Cloud**: For ML/AI heavy applications or Google ecosystem integration

2. Present 2-3 viable options with clear pros/cons
3. Make a recommendation with rationale
4. Get explicit user confirmation

Document the choice and key services that will be used.]]

**Platform:** {{selected_platform}}
**Key Services:** {{core_services_list}}
**Deployment Host and Regions:** {{regions}}

### Repository Structure

[[LLM: Define the repository approach based on PRD requirements and platform choice, explain your rationale or ask quetsions to the user if unsure:

1. For modern fullstack apps, monorepo is often preferred
2. Consider tooling (Nx, Turborepo, Lerna, npm workspaces)
3. Define package/app boundaries
4. Plan for shared code between frontend and backend]]

**Structure:** {{repo_structure_choice}}
**Monorepo Tool:** {{monorepo_tool_if_applicable}}
**Package Organization:** {{package_strategy}}

### High Level Architecture Diagram

[[LLM: Create a Mermaid diagram showing the complete system architecture including:

- User entry points (web, mobile)
- Frontend application deployment
- API layer (REST/GraphQL)
- Backend services
- Databases and storage
- External integrations
- CDN and caching layers

Use appropriate diagram type for clarity.]]

```mermaid
{{architecture_diagram}}
```

### Architectural Patterns

[[LLM: List patterns that will guide both frontend and backend development. Include patterns for:

- Overall architecture (e.g., Jamstack, Serverless, Microservices)
- Frontend patterns (e.g., Component-based, State management)
- Backend patterns (e.g., Repository, CQRS, Event-driven)
- Integration patterns (e.g., BFF, API Gateway)

For each pattern, provide recommendation and rationale.]]

<<REPEAT: pattern>>

- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}
  <</REPEAT>>

@{example: patterns}

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static site generation with serverless APIs - _Rationale:_ Optimal performance and scalability for content-heavy applications
- **Component-Based UI:** Reusable React components with TypeScript - _Rationale:_ Maintainability and type safety across large codebases
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility
- **API Gateway Pattern:** Single entry point for all API calls - _Rationale:_ Centralized auth, rate limiting, and monitoring
  @{/example}

## Tech Stack

[[LLM: This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection for the entire project. Work with user to finalize all choices. This table is the single source of truth - all development must use these exact versions.

Key areas to cover:

- Frontend and backend languages/frameworks
- Databases and caching
- Authentication and authorization
- API approach
- Testing tools for both frontend and backend
- Build and deployment tools
- Monitoring and logging

Upon render, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` display immediately.]]

## Coding Standards

[[LLM: Define MINIMAL but CRITICAL standards for AI agents. Focus only on project-specific rules that prevent common mistakes. These will be used by dev agents.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Critical Fullstack Rules

<<REPEAT: critical_rule>>

- **{{rule_name}}:** {{rule_description}}
  <</REPEAT>>

@{example: critical_rules}

- **Type Sharing:** Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- **API Calls:** Never make direct HTTP calls - use the service layer
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling:** All API routes must use the standard error handler
- **State Updates:** Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
  @{/example}

### Naming Conventions

| Element         | Frontend             | Backend    | Example             |
| :-------------- | :------------------- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| Components      | PascalCase           | -          | `UserProfile.tsx`   |
| Hooks           | camelCase with 'use' | -          | `useAuth.ts`        |
| API Routes      | -                    | kebab-case | `/api/user-profile` |
| Database Tables | -                    | snake_case | `user_profiles`     |
