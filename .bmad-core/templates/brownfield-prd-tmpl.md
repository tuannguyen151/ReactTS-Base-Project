# {{Project Name}} Brownfield Enhancement PRD

[[LLM: The default path and filename unless specified is docs/prd.md]]

[[LLM: IMPORTANT - SCOPE ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:

This PRD is for SIGNIFICANT enhancements to existing projects that require comprehensive planning and multiple stories. Before proceeding:

1. **Assess Enhancement Complexity**: If this is a simple feature addition or bug fix that could be completed in 1-2 focused development sessions, STOP and recommend: "For simpler changes, consider using the brownfield-create-epic or brownfield-create-story task with the Product Owner instead. This full PRD process is designed for substantial enhancements that require architectural planning and multiple coordinated stories."

2. **Project Context**: Determine if we're working in an IDE with the project already loaded or if the user needs to provide project information. If project files are available, analyze existing documentation in the docs folder. If insufficient documentation exists, recommend running the document-project task first.

3. **Deep Assessment Requirement**: You MUST thoroughly analyze the existing project structure, patterns, and constraints before making ANY suggestions. Every recommendation must be grounded in actual project analysis, not assumptions.]]

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

[[LLM: Gather comprehensive information about the existing project. This section must be completed before proceeding with requirements.

CRITICAL: Throughout this analysis, explicitly confirm your understanding with the user. For every assumption you make about the existing project, ask: "Based on my analysis, I understand that [assumption]. Is this correct?"

Do not proceed with any recommendations until the user has validated your understanding of the existing system.]]

### Existing Project Overview

[[LLM: If working in IDE with project loaded, analyze the project structure and existing documentation. If working in web interface, request project upload or detailed project information from user.]]

**Project Location**: [[LLM: Note if this is IDE-based analysis or user-provided information]]

**Current Project State**: [[LLM: Brief description of what the project currently does and its primary purpose]]

### Available Documentation Analysis

[[LLM: Check for existing documentation in docs folder or provided by user. List what documentation is available and assess its completeness. Required documents include:

- Tech stack documentation
- Source tree/architecture overview
- Coding standards
- API documentation or OpenAPI specs
- External API integrations
- UX/UI guidelines or existing patterns]]

**Available Documentation**:

- [ ] Tech Stack Documentation
- [ ] Source Tree/Architecture
- [ ] Coding Standards
- [ ] API Documentation
- [ ] External API Documentation
- [ ] UX/UI Guidelines
- [ ] Other: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

[[LLM: If critical documentation is missing, STOP and recommend: "I recommend running the document-project task first to generate baseline documentation including tech-stack, source-tree, coding-standards, APIs, external-APIs, and UX/UI information. This will provide the foundation needed for a comprehensive brownfield PRD."]]

### Enhancement Scope Definition

### Change Log

| Change | Date | Version | Description | Author |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |

## Requirements

[[LLM: Draft functional and non-functional requirements based on your validated understanding of the existing project. Before presenting requirements, confirm: "These requirements are based on my understanding of your existing system. Please review carefully and confirm they align with your project's reality." Then immediately execute tasks#advanced-elicitation display]]

### Functional

[[LLM: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown with identifier starting with FR]]
@{example: - FR1: The existing Todo List will integrate with the new AI duplicate detection service without breaking current functionality.}

### Non Functional

[[LLM: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown with identifier starting with NFR. Include constraints from existing system]]
@{example: - NFR1: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 20%.}

### Compatibility Requirements

[[LLM: Critical for brownfield - what must remain compatible]]

- CR1: [[LLM: Existing API compatibility requirements]]
- CR2: [[LLM: Database schema compatibility requirements]]
- CR3: [[LLM: UI/UX consistency requirements]]

**Integration Requirements**: [[LLM: Key integration points with existing system]]

[[LLM: CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING FOR BROWNFIELD:

- Stories must ensure existing functionality remains intact
- Each story should include verification that existing features still work
- Stories should be sequenced to minimize risk to existing system
- Include rollback considerations for each story
- Focus on incremental integration rather than big-bang changes
- Size stories for AI agent execution in existing codebase context
- MANDATORY: Present the complete story sequence and ask: "This story sequence is designed to minimize risk to your existing system. Does this order make sense given your project's architecture and constraints?"
- Stories must be logically sequential with clear dependencies identified
- Each story must deliver value while maintaining system integrity]]
