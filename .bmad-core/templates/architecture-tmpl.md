# {{Project Name}} Architecture Document

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. If at a minimum you cannot local `docs/prd.md` ask the user what docs will provide the basis for the architecture.]]

[[LLM: The default path and filename unless specified is docs/architecture.md]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding further with architecture design, check if the project is based on a starter template or existing codebase:

1. Review the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:

- Starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
- Existing projects or codebases being used as a foundation
- Boilerplate projects or scaffolding tools
- Previous projects to be cloned or adapted

2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:

- Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
  - Link to the starter template documentation
  - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
  - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
  - Pre-configured technology stack and versions
  - Project structure and organization patterns
  - Built-in scripts and tooling
  - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
  - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
- Use this analysis to inform and align your architecture decisions

3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:

- Suggest appropriate starter templates based on the tech stack preferences
- Explain the benefits (faster setup, best practices, community support)
- Let the user decide whether to use one

4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:

- Proceed with architecture design from scratch
- Note that manual setup will be required for all tooling and configuration

Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. In none, just say N/A

After presenting this starter template section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Change Log

[[LLM: Track document versions and changes]]

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| :--- | :------ | :---------- | :----- |

## High Level Architecture

[[LLM: This section contains multiple subsections that establish the foundation of the architecture. Present all subsections together (Introduction, Technical Summary, High Level Overview, Project Diagram, and Architectural Patterns), then apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol to the complete High Level Architecture section. The user can choose to refine the entire section or specific subsections.]]

### Technical Summary

[[LLM: Provide a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview of:

- The system's overall architecture style
- Key components and their relationships
- Primary technology choices
- Core architectural patterns being used
- Reference back to the PRD goals and how this architecture supports them]]

### High Level Overview

[[LLM: Based on the PRD's Technical Assumptions section, describe:

1. The main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven)
2. Repository structure decision from PRD (Monorepo/Polyrepo)
3. Service architecture decision from PRD
4. Primary user interaction flow or data flow at a conceptual level
5. Key architectural decisions and their rationale

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### High Level Project Diagram

[[LLM: Create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the high-level architecture. Consider:

- System boundaries
- Major components/services
- Data flow directions
- External integrations
- User entry points

Use appropriate Mermaid diagram type (graph TD, C4, sequence) based on what best represents the architecture

After presenting the diagram, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Architectural and Design Patterns

[[LLM: List the key high-level patterns that will guide the architecture. For each pattern:

1. Present 2-3 viable options if multiple exist
2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
4. These patterns should align with the PRD's technical assumptions and project goals

Common patterns to consider:

- Architectural style patterns (Serverless, Event-Driven, Microservices, CQRS, Hexagonal)
- Code organization patterns (Dependency Injection, Repository, Module, Factory)
- Data patterns (Event Sourcing, Saga, Database per Service)
- Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, Message Queue, Pub/Sub)]]

<<REPEAT: pattern>>

- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}

<</REPEAT>>

@{example: patterns}

- **Serverless Architecture:** Using AWS Lambda for compute - _Rationale:_ Aligns with PRD requirement for cost optimization and automatic scaling
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Using SNS/SQS for service decoupling - _Rationale:_ Supports async processing and system resilience

@{/example}

[[LLM: After presenting the patterns, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

## Tech Stack

[[LLM: This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. Work with the user to make specific choices:

1. Review PRD technical assumptions and any preferences from `data#technical-preferences` or an attached `technical-preferences`
2. For each category, present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons
3. Make a clear recommendation based on project needs
4. Get explicit user approval for each selection
5. Document exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions)
6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about - let the user know if they are not sure on any that you can also provide suggestions with rationale:

- Starter templates (if any)
- Languages and runtimes with exact versions
- Frameworks and libraries / packages
- Cloud provider and key services choices
- Database and storage solutions - if unclear suggest sql or nosql or other types depending on the project and depending on cloud provider offer a suggestion
- Development tools

Upon render of the table, ensure the user is aware of the importance of this sections choices, should also look for gaps or disagreements with anything, ask for any clarifications if something is unclear why its in the list, and also right away apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` display - this statement and the options should be rendered and then prompt right all before allowing user input.]]
