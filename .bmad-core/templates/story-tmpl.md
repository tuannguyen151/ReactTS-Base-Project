## Dev Notes

[[LLM: populates relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story. Do not invent information. Critical: If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story. If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, also include them here if it will help the dev agent. You do NOT need to repeat anything from coding standards or test standards as the dev agent is already aware of those. The dev agent should NEVER need to read the PRD or architecture documents or child documents though to complete this self contained story, because your critical mission is to share the specific items needed here extremely concisely for the Dev Agent LLM to comprehend with the least about of context overhead token usage needed.]]

### Testing

[[LLM: Scrum Master use `test-strategy-and-standards.md` to leave instruction for developer agent in the following concise format, leave unchecked if no specific test requirement of that type]]
Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] {{type f.e. Jest}} Unit Tests: (nextToFile: {{true|false}}), coverage requirement: {{from strategy or default 80%}}
- [ ] {{type f.e. Jest with in memory db}} Integration Test (Test Location): location: {{Integration test location f.e. `/tests/story-name/foo.spec.cs` or `next to handler`}}
- [ ] {{type f.e. Cypress}} E2E: location: {{f.e. `/e2e/{epic-name/bar.test.ts`}}

Manual Test Steps: [[LLM: Include how if possible the user can manually test the functionality when story is Ready for Review, if any]]

{{ f.e. `- dev will create a script with task 3 above that you can run with "npm run test-initiate-launch-sequence" and validate Armageddon is initiated`}}
